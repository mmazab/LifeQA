# LifeQA Analysis

## Setup

1. Download the questions to a file named `questions.txt`, one questions per line.
2. Tokenize it with `tokenizer.py`.
3. Follow the installation procedure from [jPTDP](https://github.com/datquocnguyen/jPTDP) to
convert the file with the `model256` model and predict the dependency parsing, placing the output in `output/questions`.

## Run

Just run `./stats.py` or `./subject.py`.

00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:36,844
[woman] and we’re ready to make breakfast for Brian I’ve got a few gifts for him and I am really excited to celebrate Brian today because he is such a good dad and I feel like being  a good dad  does not have to do with like just taking care of your kid it kind of has to do with being a good husband and being of a help to the mom who usually ends up taking a lot of responsibility but he tries to step in whenever he can and it’s just so nice it makes him  a good dad especially when I’m pregnant because

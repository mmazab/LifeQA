[Child 1]: We had a lot of suggestions to do the pizza challenge, so here it is
[Child 2]: Yeah!!
[Child 1]: Okay, so I was going to have my friend come over and do this challenge with me but she's not here
[Child 2]: Pizza challenge
[Child 1]: So I'm going to do this challenge with my dad!![claps hands] Woo
[Child 1]: In this pizza challenge, in this cup we have 4 tickets on it like a piece of paper has this dough labelled on it.
[Child 1]: Two of each, I'm going to pick one and he's going to pick one and whichever dough I pick out of here
[Child 1]: is the dough I'm going to use for my pizza, same for my dad.
[Child 1]: And then there's 18 labelled pieces of paper in here with things in these bags.
[Child 1]: Brittany wanted to store in these things and I've no idea what they are 
[Child 1]: but we'll pick like one of them and we'll put them on our pizza
[Child 1]: So we have the sauce and the cheeses and we have the olive oil and everything that we need for the pizzas
[Child 2]: [Repeatedly calls out daddy]
[Child 1]: This challenge is going to be a lot of fun.

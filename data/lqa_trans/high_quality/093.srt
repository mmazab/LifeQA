[man] impressed and Jarred I’m sure I will FaceTime you later and we can talk about this guitar and like what is capable of and stuff and I actually found a really cool app on the Apple TV it has lessons right on here where I can go through like the [inaudible] memorizing the strings cords and that good stuff so I figure when I’m   with Jerry and Jeffrey and other people that know how to play the guitar I can totally look on this app and just sit down in my chair and maybe learn this way that would be really cool I really really wanna learn I got got ukulele and

[man] I loved playing that and I know a couple of cords on it but my fingers are so thick and they cut the strings when I try to strung and I just don’t know if it was really for me  so I’m really excited to have a guitar and get to learn because I’ve been writing new music constantly ever since I released [inaudible]  Lion and I just  sit down with my guitar and write music I think that would be really fun you’re basically the best [woman] thank you [man] seriously

good morning guys and Happy Father's Day today is Father's Day all are up bright and early and we're getting ready to make breakfast for Brian I've got a few gifts for him and I'm really excited to just celebrate Brian today cuz he is such a good dad and I feel like being a good dad does not just have to do with like taking care of your kid it kind of has to do with being a good husband and being like a help to the mom who taking on a lot of the responsibility but he tries to step in wherever he can and it's just so nice and makes him a good. Especially when I'm pregnant cuz he can't really be a good dad to this little boy other than just helping me and he does really good at that he definitely takes care of us very well so today is all about Brian and so we've got gifts for him even saying something special for going to make some breakfast for making french toast bacon and a couple of donuts on there

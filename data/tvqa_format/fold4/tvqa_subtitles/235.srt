1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,500
take all the pieces out you can put them here or here while you take them out

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,800
 you going to hold them all that is that one

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,800
 it looks like part of the letter and part of the Rat Pack

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,800
 that's the area you might have to turn it

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,199
 turn it on the puzzle board until it fits into place

6
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:34,100
 that's the right area the steps of the ladder are going this way

7
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:45,500
 so you turn it to match the direction the steps are going poster for almost there turn up that way that working out for you

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,100
 did you catch this a good idea to put what in places and see

9
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,500
 give it a try it looks like more of the ladder

10
00:01:05,60599 --> 00:01:16,60599
 Legos I see that it's got a fireman and a half and a eyes and nose and mouth so what other one has fireman's with eyes and nose and mouth

11
00:01:18,60400 --> 00:01:19,60400
 can you match it

12
00:01:21,60500 --> 00:01:22,60900

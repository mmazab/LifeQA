 I wanted to get rid of this one because of all the times you had to delete game files so you could make more room for your Minecraft world and all that this one is a 500 gig XBox 360

00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:52,200
 we don't have to delete any more right got plenty of room will take you up on cloud storage so you'll never run out of room again

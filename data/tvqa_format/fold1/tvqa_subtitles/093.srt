I can seriously not believe that this is my guitar this is so cool look how beautiful this thing is I'm so impressed and Jared I'm sure I'll FaceTime you later and we can talk all about this guitar and like what is capable of and stuff found a really cool app on the Apple TV it has lessons right on here that I can go through like the tuning memorizing the strings and chords and all that good stuff so I figure when I'm not hanging out with Jared or Jeffery or other people that know how to play the guitar I can totally just like look on this app and just sit down in my chair maybe learn this way they'll be really cool I really really want to learn I know I got it I got a ukulele and I love playing that I know a couple of Courts on it but my fingers are so thick and they caught the strings when I tried to strum I just don't know if it was really for me I'm really excited to have a guitar and get to learn on it cuz I've been writing new music constantly ever since I released like the Lions and I would love to just sit down with my guitar and write music I think that would be really really fun
